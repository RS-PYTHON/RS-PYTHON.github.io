RS Python proposes JupyterLab as virtual environment to build and start your custom processing chain.


With JupyterLab you will have: 
1. **Unified Environment**:
   - JupyterLab combines various tools into a single interface. It integrates classic notebooks, a text editor, a terminal, and a directory viewer, making it a unified experience for data scientists.
   - You'll no longer feel like you're working with separate software; everything is conveniently accessible in one place.

2. **Flexible Layouts**:
   - JupyterLab offers flexible layouts, allowing you to organize your workspace as you prefer. You can drag and drop tabs, resize them, and arrange them to suit your needs.
   - This feature enables efficient multitasking, especially when working with multiple notebooks or files simultaneously.

3. **Support for Various File Formats**:
   - In addition to notebooks, JupyterLab supports other file formats like JPEG, PDF, and CSV. You can view and work with these files directly within the interface.
   - Having everything under one roof streamlines your workflow and saves time.

4. **Collapsible Left Sidebar**:
   - JupyterLab's collapsible left sidebar contains commonly used tabs, such as the file browser, running kernels, and a command palette.
   - This sidebar enhances efficiency by providing quick access to essential features².

You can build or start already made Prefect worflows from RS client libraries. 
RS-Client python libraries and some examples are provided to ease the use of RS Python.
