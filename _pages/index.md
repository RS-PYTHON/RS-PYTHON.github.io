    excerpt: "The Reference System server offers essential services for building Copernicus processing workflows, all secured by stringent access controls. With RS-Server, STAC integration is seamless. RS-Server features a comprehensive catalog of Sentinel products, fully compatible with the STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) standard. Additionally, it provides STAC interfaces to retrieve AUXIP and CADIP data. A versatile staging function rounds out this robust suite of services."

    title: "RS-Server staging"
    excerpt: "The rs-server offers staging functionality with access control for retrieving products from external data sources. The rs-server grants access to auxiliary data from the AUXIP station, as well as telemetry raw data from CADIP stations. It will also provide access to Sentinel level-0 products from LTA and Level-1 and Level-2 products from PRIP."

    title: "Processing workflow as a code"
    excerpt: "RS Python leverages the Prefect orchestrator for managing and automating workflows. Prefect simplifies workflow management, reduces operational costs, and provides a smoother experience for data orchestration compared to other tools. Its flexibility, quick adoption, and supportive community make it an excellent choice for RSâ€™s workflow needs."

    title: "Virtual environment"
    excerpt: "RS Python provides access to JupyterLab to end-user. The end-user can build or start already made Prefect worflows from rs-client libraries. JupyterLab proposes a flexible workspace organization to users making it easier to work with multiple tabs simultaneously. Additionally, JupyterLab provides a comprehensive Markdown editor, enhancing the writing and documentation experience within notebooks.
    JupyterLab offers a richer and more efficient data programming experience, making it a wise choice for RS."
