Visit the [FAQ page](https://beautifuljekyll.com/faq) for answers to commonly asked questions.

**If you choose to [become a sponsor](https://beautifuljekyll.com/plans/), you'll have access to my [office hours](https://beautifuljekyll.com/officehours/) where you can ask for help.** You can also use the [Discussions](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/discussions) area to try and get help from the community.

Beautiful Jekyll is used by 50,000+ people with wildly varying degrees of web skills, so it's impossible to answer all the questions that may arise. For any question that's not specifically related to Beautiful Jekyll and is more about Jekyll or web development in general, the answer can often be found on Google, in the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/), or on the [Jekyll support forum](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/).

# Credits

This template was not made *entirely* from scratch. I'd like to give special thanks to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog), from whom I've taken several ideas initially.

I'd also like to thank [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and another [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllrc.github.io/jekyllthemes/) for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.
